Yemechiw Zemen Technologina Nuro (The Future Technology and Life) is a book that explains in simple language the new nanotechnology and its impact on the future reorganization of production, communities, governments and world order. The world seems to have reached to a refined stage of technology which at last would enable society to build the utopia it was dreaming for long. In the Book of Henok, it is written that God had created two worlds at the beginning. One was the earth where humans dwelt. On the other world God left a number of angels to guide and follow up humans development. The angels in the other world descended to earth and tried to improve human development, using genetic engineering. God was offended and he returned back with his followers to punish the rebellious angels. The angels of the second world asked Henok to beg God mercy for them. When Henok approached God with such an appeal God told him that angels, the rebellious angels included, were built from fire and wind and are immortals. God told Henok that humans are made from blood and flesh and their immortality is through breeding from generation to generation. Through such breeding, in the far future humans would develop and becomes similar to God and his angels and attain immortality. At that time, God said, he would descend to earth and will live with humans. From that day of Henok's encounter with God, humans were praying for the coming of God's kingdom. May nanotechnology, 3 d printing, nano particles lead all of us to transform into God's sons and daughters and may the world prosper and we gain immortality. Amen. The rest you would find it in the book.
